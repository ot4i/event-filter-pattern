        <div>
            <p class="shortdesc"></p>
        </div>
        <p>This pattern uses IBM Integration Bus to receive many events from mobile clients via IBM MessageSight and filter on the events of interest.</p>

		<p>Use this pattern when:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Large numbers of mobile clients are publishing messages</li>
		<li>The mobile clients are connected to IBM MessageSight</li>
		<li>Only a subset of messages published require processing by a back-end system</li>
    	</ul>    
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="sectiontitle">Solution</h2>
        </div>
        
		<p>With a potentially high volume of clients producing event messages via IBM MessageSight, enabling business processing for every event may overload back-end systems.  By using the Event Filter Pattern only messages of interest are forwarded to the back-end systems for business processing, whilst less important messages are logged.  For example medical devices such as pacemaker monitors may continuously publish events about the status of the patient and the device.  Events containing regular status updates may be logged whilst those containing high severity alerts can be filtered to the business processing systems immediately.</p>
