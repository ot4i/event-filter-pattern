        <p>IBM MessageSight is an appliance-based messaging server that is designed to handle large numbers 
		of connected clients and devices, and process high volumes of messages with consistent latency.</p>
		
		<p>Internet clients can publish messages to IBM MessageSight that are then forwarded to 
		services within a company's intranet.  By using IBM Integration Bus, you can prepare the messages  
		for processing by back-end systems or further publication to other clients.</p>	
		
		<p>You can also use IBM Integration Bus to process messages from back-end systems in order to create topics that 
		are published on IBM MessageSight. Internet clients can subscribe to specific topics on IBM MessageSight so 
		that they are notified of new messages when they are published.</p>
		
		<p>The diagram shows an overview of the components and connections within an IBM MessageSight solution.</p>

    	<p>IBM MessageSight supports both publish/subscribe and point-to-point messaging. IBM MessageSight is a 
    	subject-based, publish/subscribe broker so the content of messages is not queried or altered by IBM MessageSight, 
    	and no user-based applications can run on IBM MessageSight.</p>
